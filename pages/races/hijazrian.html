                        The origins of the Hijazrian Empire date back to the first ages of men when the warrior king Hajanarma united the southern clans and formed the Dolon-Abdar, the great pact between the southern men and the dwarves of the Serpent Spine. Due to this peace and open trade between man and dwarf, the two cultures grew in wealth and power. In time the Hijazrian Empire stretched from the Rathe mountains to the coasts of the the Feerott. Even now, the many civilizations of men have yet to match the technological prowess and architectural masterpieces of the first empire of men in the south. Influence with the dying remnant of the Takish Empire taught these early men the basics of magic and from this early foundation, Hijazrian culture developed a strong tradition of scholasticism. But by the end of the first age Hijazrin society had decayed substantially. A long and drawn out campaign against the second uprising of the Ykeshan Empire had left the landscape ravished and trade disputes with the neighboring dwarves of the Serpent Spine created a shortage of food and funding resulting in a mass exodus of Hijazrians to the north. At this same time the fledgling Combine Empire was growing in influence as Antronix I marched his armies across the plains of Karana. The then Emperor of the Hijazrin people, Aparajita, saw the forthcoming doom of his empire and in a desperate attempt to solidify goodwill and influence with the growing empire of the north, he wed his daughter to the son of Antronix I, forever uniting the two royal families and ensuring a place for the Hijazrin people in this new empire.

                        Until the Combine Empire, Hijazrin religion had long been centered on the abstract and formless “Tranquil One.” Not so much an organized institution as it was a philosophical and scholastic pursuit, Hijazrin society sought to practice pacifism and embrace altruism, seeking for inner peace and tranquility. With the formal annex of Hijazria into the Combine Empire shortly after the union between the Hijazrian princess and the Combine prince, ideology and ways of thinking from the north became increasingly more prevalent in the collective, Hijazrian mind. The adopted religion of the Combine Empire was that of Light Worship and as the doctrines and concepts evolved to include Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr the same personification of deity occurred with the “Tranquil One.” It became Her, Quellious, the Tranquil Lady, daughter of Erollisi Marr the Queen of Love. She was succeeded by a focus on her son, Morell, the Prince of Dreams and thus the Quellian priesthood was formed.

                        Like the Priest’s of Marr in the Combine, the Quellian Priesthood waxed and waned in power in the vassal kingdom of Hijazria during the days of the Empire. While always influential, at times the priesthood took a back seat to politicking. However, of particular prominence was its role shortly after the outbreak of the Thulian frenzy. Reports circulating from the deep jungles of the Feerott brought back disturbing tales of rising discontent among the populace and unorthodox religious practices. The priesthood claimed these men had been led astray by false visions and prophesyings by the wicked. These new religious practices focused on the “Faceless” god, an ancient demon known as Thule. A growing cult formed around these practices deep in the dark swamps of the Feerrot.  There they enslaved the lizardmen and built a grand temple complex dedicated to Cazic worship.  Growing in influence, the cult began to appear in small clandestine sects throughout the cities of the Hijazrian vassal engulfing many citizens, even notable statesmen.  When the secret was discovered by the Quellian priesthood, the vassal lord ordered the slaughter of all unrepentant practitioners and a crusade against the jungle temple ensued. Though they resisted, the priests of Fear were massacred, the temple grounds stained with blood. For the next several years, power without discretion was given to the Quellian priesthood and many guilty of cult practices were executed… as well as many innocents. The organized religion with a head prophet, centered in the Feerrot, became extinct, yet many small cult uprisings would continue to plague the struggling empire for centuries to come. In recent years rumors of the temple still being in operation have circulated, though its inhabitants are not the Hijazrian worshippers but rather the Tae Ew, a tribe of lizardmen who have taken up residence, enslaving the local Vol Ew lizardmen. These reports, however, are unfounded.

                        Following these disturbing events and leading up to the fall of the Combine Empire, an “enlightenment” movement led by the notable statesman and philosopher, Erud began to gain momentum. Disgusted by the overbearing Quellian Priesthood and the deterioration of the ancient Hijazrian legacy of scholasticism, Erud gained a group of followers, nationalists with a strong distaste for the Combine empire. Overtime, they became increasingly more vocal and riots within the city began to break out. The Quellian priesthood provided strong pushback which brought with it even greater resentment from the people. Tensions boiled high and it seemed violence would erupt at any moment. Erud, who had begun his movement as a peaceful endeavor was sickened by the events that were transpiring. He fled the vassal kingdom with a sizeable band of followers crossing the sea and settling in Odus where they founded the city of Erudin Today it stands as a beacon in support of the pursuit of knowledge with the largest library in all of Norrath and the most prestigious arcane schools.

                        With the growing conflicts in Hijazria and many others pressures throughout the world, the Combine Empire collapsed and the sovereign emperor fled to the capital city of Hijazria. The flames of rebellion in the people were moderately tempered as the emperor marched into the capital city with his 5,000 troops. Today Hijazria is but a weak reflection of its former wealth and splendor. The capital city has decayed over the course of hundreds of years and the weak pretend king of the broken Combine Empire attempts to maintain rule over his small dominion though some claim his faculties are not all there. The cities throughout the Rathe Mountains run rampant with corruption and violence and the jungles of the Feerott are wild and dangerous but one can still feel the power of the once great Hijazrian empire through the countless monuments they left behind.

                        Today very few Hijazrians continue to live in the lands of their southern empire having migrated to larger cities such as Freeport and Maj’Dul where “Little Hijazria” districts have formed. The very few that remain in their crumbling cities in the now untamed Rathe mountains are quiet, private, xenophobic and mostly ignorant of the great power and knowledge their people once had.
