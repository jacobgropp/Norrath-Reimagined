                        The Men of the East will forever be tied to their great city of Freeport. The region round about the city is the homeland of the ancient Midinsian people, former slaves of the Takish rulers who were liberated after the Dal Exodus. Because of this the Midinsians, while peaceful, have always sought for freedom, freedom from the oppressive Northmen clans, freedom from the grasp of the Combine Empire, and today, the freedom to rule themselves as they see fit. With an ancient religion tied back to the early days of the Combine, some even saying far earlier than that, it was inevitable that the location of Freeport would become the seat of the Commonwealth’s power.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The city of Freeport is divided into several quarters, the oldest and one of the most prominent being the Old City, centered on the ancient temple complex devoted to the Marr Twins. Legend tells of  the great high elven prophet Velishul who, in Elder days, had a glorious vision of the Two here: “behold, the garden of our people, the orchard of Truth. Sow and reap.” Though this tale has been scrutinized by scholars, Combine histories tell of an elven shrine, surrounded by fruitful orchards and flowered fields. Teir’Dal conquests razed the shrine, and the land was held by the dark elves for several centuries until the Combine fought back their empire and claimed the land as their own. A temple to Marr was quickly erected, not coincidentally on the ancient foundations of the elven shrine.

                    <p>
                        This became a center of Truth worship and scholasticism for many centuries. A small town grew around it, and a burgeoning trade route found it convenient to stop here on its way north from the Dervish tribes of the desert to the city of Dalrinian, capital of the eastern Combine province of Midian and the center of its power. The agrarian economy flourished as had the ancient elven outpost, but as the population swelled, the inhabitants began to interpret Marr’s ancient words as a garden of Their people, that is, a new, blossoming “garden-city” of Men, the now-favored children of the Two. The growing community eventually fused with a nearby port several miles to the southeast. Amidst the modern political turmoil, the pious and conservative blame Freeport’s spiraling morals and corruption on this seedy and rotten ancestry stemming from the port city.

                    <p>
                        After the Teir’Dal Empire overthrew Dalrinian several centuries later, Galareth (as Freeport was then called), surprisingly held its own against the encroaching dark elf armies. Again, the religious spirit of the city accredited this to the favor of the Twins. As a result, Galareth replaced Dalrinian as the seat of power in the region--politically, militarily, economically, and religiously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the Combine Empire fell, the eastern provinces rapidly divided themselves up into small kingdoms. However, Galareth held sway over a larger area, and, unusually, established a ruling council which later evolved into a quasi-republic. This was a stark contrast to the neighboring realms of New Midian in the north and Dalarish in the Badlands whose presiding military generals swiftly declared themselves kings, eventually spiraling into chaos and anarchy. Inspired by their progressive and liberal politics, the citizens renamed their fair city Freeport. Indeed, the inhabitants ever since have been incredibly proud of their democratic heritage, perhaps to a fault: it is one of the, albeit few, points of contention between the Eastern Commonwealth of Freeport and the Kingdom of Bayle.

                        Today, the Old City remains well-kept and beloved, its cobbled streets and marble walls swept and polished. It is one of the wealthier districts, surpassed only by Market Corner and the Court of Ten. To the south, however, the slums continue to spread and poverty deepens. It is not uncommon to hear of the inhabitants turning away from Marr to other gods, some of them rather unorthodox to say the least.

                    <p>
                        This new-found corruption is only heightened by the city’s policing force, the Freeport Militia. In an attempt to empower the people, the Freeport Militia was designed as a volunteer, standing army and guard force created by the people, for the people. In theory, it was revolutionary, allowing the citizens of Freeport to essentially protect themselves. In practice it has proven to have severe problems. The Militia has become wrought with corruption and the abuse of power. When they are not frequenting the many brothels in the lower quarters, they are terrorizing innocents and accepting bribes from the growing mercantile class. This sort of corruption and government oversight has become extremely apparent in the port district where smuggling of illegal goods is overlooked on a daily basis.

                    <p>
                        However, not all of the Militia is full of thugs and brigands. In recent years, the captain of the Freeport Militia, Sir Lucan D’Lere has brought about a refreshing level of order to the city’s guard force, providing many of the city’s downtrodden with a sense of justice, disciplining his forces. The commander has run the militia for the last 5 years though he has been a member for nearly 50. Those that have met him, however, claim he does not look a day over 30. But despite these attempts to strengthen and restore justice to the militia, some claim the officers in the volunteer guard force to be engaged in seedy dealings with the Coalition of Tradesfolke, the largest and most powerful mercantile guild in the city. Others claim even more nefarious dealings with dark, otherworldly powers outside of Freeport but these are nothing more than the ramblings of the city’s more superstitious lot as Freeport’s lower class have long been rampant with fanatic extremism.

                        Perhaps the most famous aspect of the city, though, is the modern Academy of Arcane Science, a grouping of mages and scholars from across Norrath who have come to the city study. The Academy is deeply engaged in the city’s scholastic tradition and is a complement to the Temple of Marr. Among the more renowned members is the high elf, Opal Darkbriar and Erudite Palon Deskab. Long ago, even the famous Al’Kabor visited the academy and studied their for a time.
