                    <p>To understand the history of the Great House of Bayle and thus
                        the origins of their Kingdom in the West one must approach the
                        subject from the context of the Combine Empire. The House of
                        Bayle had solidified itself as one of the twelve Great Houses
                        of Men near the end of the Combine era. Hectimus Bayle had been
                        granted lands by the Combine Emperor along the Coldwind coast
                        several hundred leagues to the north of the capital city for his
                        heroics in the Battle of the White Lily. It was here that he amassed
                        a fortune, harvesting an exotic purple dye from the glands of the
                        Coldwind octopi. In time a city-state named Qeynos was formed and
                        from then on it was the seat of the great Bayle family. To this day,
                        while the House of Bayle has found mercantile opportunities in many
                        different industries over the years, dye, specifically purple
                        dye, still remains as their number one export and the main source
                        of their incredible wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Though scholars agree there were many events that led to the fall
                        of the Combine Empire, perhaps the most apparent was the War of
                        Plagues which saw the capital city under constant siege both from
                        without and within. During this time Valeria Bayle, the daughter
                        of Antonious Bayle was to be wed to the soon to be crown prince,
                        Cahirim VI but both were stricken with the plague before their
                        wedding day. With the city slipping into chaos with each passing
                        day the Bayle’s fled to their northern stronghold in the city of
                        Qeynos.
                    </p>
                    <p>With the empire crumbling under the encroaching pressure from all
                       sides and with a clear view of the approaching chaos that would
                       ensure, Antonious chose to wed his other daughter Tatiana Bayle
                       to High Lord Dara of the Erudian House Tal-Azroth. House Tal’Azroth
                       had been at the forefront of Combine philosophy and education for
                       the last 100 years and had a history that seated them deep in
                       Combine legacy. The marriage was a political move on the part of
                       Antonious to solidify his ties with the Combine Empire so that,
                       upon it’s inevitable fall which he foresaw, he would have a strong
                       Combine influence to garner support from the masses.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Combining their incredible wealth and power, the two great houses
                       struck a deal with House Ironforge and Clothspinner in the form of
                       several hundred acres of land, some of which Lord Antonious had no
                       right to divy up at the time, and an ample amount of gold. Antonious
                       now had a source of ongoing economic support but he required an army
                       as no man is able to hold onto his power without a sizeable number of
                       steel and iron in his hands. He found one in the northern houses of
                       Redjford and Thenrick. While difficult to sway as they had never been
                       fond of the Combine rulers to the south, Antonious was eventually able
                       to bring them to reason though not without a significant cost. Lord
                       Antonious sent two of his sons to be wards for House Redjford, while
                       Lord Dana of house Tal’Azroth was forced to wed his only daughter, a
                       mere girl of 15 years, to the 84 year old Lord Perun of House Thenrick. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Now with an army, wealth, and political backing, Lord Antonious seemed
                        fit to make his move yet he still desired one thing more, religion.
                        While believing in no gods himself, Antonious understood the power of
                        theology and its sway over the people. The Combine had long neglected
                        religion as a tool of control and Antonious thought to rectify that.
                        The newly formed Church of Thunder was led by a zealous priest by the
                        name of Rylin Moltor. It served as a connection between the common farmers
                        and peasants of the Karanas and the Knight of Truth to the east. Antonious
                        made Rylin a general and promised him lands as well as priestly authority
                        in his new order. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After the capital city fell and the Combine Emperor fled to the
                       Hijazrian fortress of Bastion in the Rathe mountains, Antonious
                       turned his armies south to quell Lord Grimrot and his army of
                       Plaguebringers. Years of preparation had left Antonious with a powerful,
                       near unstoppable army and Rylin Moltor proved to be just as capable and
                       zealous a general as he was a priest. Antonious’ army cut through the
                       forces of Lord Grimrot like butter and within just a few, short months
                       the conflict was over. Lord Grimrot, however, and many of his followers
                       fled into the Serpent Spine and, though Antonious sent countless battalions
                       into the mountains to root them out, they have not been seen since.
                    </p>
                    <p>Though some theorize that the Combine Empire would not have fallen if Lord
                        Antonious Bayle had arrived earlier, nonetheless, the people of the empire
                        greeted him with open arms. The ruling class of the Combine Empire retreated
                        to the Rathe mountains broken economically and militarily. Today it resides
                        as little more than a hollow shell of its former glory. Lord Antonious Bayle
                        seized the lands from Everfrost Peaks to the southernmost regions of the
                        Karanas. His great gamble had been a success. He was crowned king and granted
                        many lands to houses Ironforge and Clothspinner and established the Church of
                        Thunder headed by Rylin Moltor. To this day his family continues to rule from
                        the seat of Qeynos. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Today, the Kingdom of Bayle is ruled by Antonious IV. It has grown into a
                        powerful nation with close ties to the Eastern Commonwealth of Freeport as
                        well as the Halasian Federation to the north. The Church of Thunder has been
                        abandoned by the royal family for the Church of Rodcet Nife, the Prime Healer
                        after years of religious stagnation and political embarrassment. Rumors abound
                        as to the return of Lord Grimrot and his followers the Bloodsabers though these
                        rumors cannot be corroborated. Some, however, even claim the king’s brother,
                        Kyle Bayle to be involved somehow. The royal family has yet to comment on any
                        of this speculation.
