                        In the ancient, oral traditions of the Northmen one finds the story of Alfi and Yarhma, the first man and woman. Having been awakened to eternal life high in the branches of a great white oak, they lived in peace and plenty for many ages taught by “The Gods,” here used as an ambiguous term denoting no particular god but rather all and none at the same time. While high in the tree, above the worries of the world, they ate the fresh, golden fruit from the strong branches of the mighty oak, an image that is still represented often in Northmen art even today, specifically in burial mounds and temples. It is said that Alfi had an insatiable appetite for the fruit and ate so much he became fat and fell into a deep slumber. While asleep the branch he laid upon snapped and he fell to the cold, hard ground. Upon waking up he could not find Yarhma for she was still high in the tree, growing wise as she spoke with the Gods. Alfi heard her voice carry in the wind and tried to pull down the trunk of the tree but was not strong enough to do so. Near the tree was a small hill and Alfi climbed the hill, hoping to be able to see Yarhma from atop it. As he climbed he could hear her voice but upon reaching the top she was no where to be seen. Each day Alfi climbed the hill to hear the voice of Yarhma until he grew strong and one day pulled the trunk of the tree down, bringing Yarhma to him. The two were happy to be reunited but saddened to be separated from the Gods. In their loneliness they chose to have children and taught them of the of the great gods above.

                        It is unknown whether Alfi and Yarhma are factual characters from Northman history or rather archetypes developed by story-tellers for man and woman. The religion that the story credits them with teaching their children was actually developed much later and is a conglomeration of many different Northmen beliefs from various tribes and clans throughout the region. Scholars agree that this religion was developed by Hahlin, King of North, the first man to unite the feuding, barbarian factions. Hahlin appropriated many of the tenants and teachings of the Northern gods of today from various spiritual figures and ancestors of the clans roundabout his own ancient home of Halas. Together they became the Tribunal, a council of divine justice uniquely fit for northmen society.

                        While Hahlin was the first King of the North there has seldom been a time of lasting peace in northern history. Before Hahlin, King of the North, it is believed there had been 100 years of constant struggle and warfare. This time period is known in the North as “The Shattering.” The gruff and surly men and women that make their homes in the valleys and mountains of the north have always been at one another’s throats. Yet, they have continued to remain a near unconquerable force for millenia. While there have been Kings of the North there have never been a successful King from the South who conquered the free, northern people. It is said that a northman would rather piss from his mouth then bend his spear to a ruler from the south. During the Combine era, several conquering kings attempted to subdue the north and all were unsuccessful. The Combine emperor, Quintus II was the closest to submitting northerners under his rule. At one time he controlled the entirety of the Nest just before he was overthrown and driven out. Ironically, immediately afterwards Karadok, son of Jora united the warring clans and, as King of the North, marched on the south, eventually capturing the capital city. He and his sons ruled a disjointed Combine Empire for a short time before they were displaced by a Hijazrian dynasty. Shortly thereafter, the Combine fell into chaos as the warrior emperors overthrew the Darshan dynasty, flinging the empire into chaos for 60 years.

                        The Northmen had their fair share of conquerors and warrior emperors during this time and when all was said and done the Combine was left in a crippled, beaten state. A man named Joneric Brunhild and his sons brought a short-lived peace to the empire. He stripped the powers of the emperor, leaving no room for conquest and bloodshed and in time the Combine recovered but never reached its former glory again. Eventually, with encroaching pressures in every corner of the world, the Combine Empire fell with the emperor fleeing to the vassal kingdom of Hijazria.

                        In these dark times, chaos consumed the continent with warlords and brigands throughout the broken and crumbled empire seizing lands and titles for their own from the immense power vacuum that had been left. The north was no different, plunging into a 30 year period of almost constant conflict. Warlords rose to dispel one another and brothers fought against brothers. The land was ravaged and many call this period of time the Second Shattering. It took a man like Hahlin, King of the North to return the region to a modicum of order.

                        Bryngarin, like Hahlin, a man from the ancestral home of Halas, rose to unite the clans once again. He set up a federation of ruling jarls in each of the ancestral homes of the north to bring order. This system has been held in place ever since. While there has been conflict from time to time, the north has experienced greater peace then it has in centuries. Some compare the days of today to the golden age of King Hahlin long ago. Open trade has united the northern federation to the various kingdoms and strongholds of the south building strong relationships though the north will always hold onto their ancient grudges and distaste for the “weaker men.”
