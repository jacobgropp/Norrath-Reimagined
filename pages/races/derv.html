                <article class="history">
                    <p>Scholars do not agree on the origins of the desert people of Ro commonly referred to as the Dervs. After the elves vacated their desolate, dying forests in eastern Antonica, the region today known as the Desert of Ro sat empty of civilization for ages. Even the sturdy deathfist orcs dared not cross the perilous region choosing to instead lurk within their Rujarkian strongholds to the south. But in the early days of the Combine empire, reports surfaced of a nomadic people inhabiting the innermost regions of Ro near an oasis that had long been believed to have dried up. Soon after, they came to act as guides for desperate travelers looking to cross the vast expanse of the desert. These travelers would bring back exotic and interesting trinkets sold to them by the strange, nomadic people. As trade increased the dervs came to cultivate the ore fertile lands of the desert near the Lifire river. Here they set up a strong civilization. Extremely accommodating, the Dervs welcomed travelers with open arms until late into the Combine era when convoys of soldiers were sent to bring the region into submission. Conflict quickly became inevitable.
                    </p>
                    <p>While several attempts were made by the empire to bring the region into order and establish it as a city-state, all were unsuccessful. This was usually due to poor planning by a number of inept military commanders, resulting in a shortage of water and food during the trek through the desert. However, as time went on the Dervish people were found to be resistant to submission. The Combine armies, not familiar with the terrain of the desert or the guerilla warfare tactics of its denizens, fell to the swift, curved blades of the Dervs. According to Combine propaganda of the time, the Dervs were a savage race of half-man, half-orcs. This was far from the truth. In reality, the Dervs were highly skilled warriors who knew the terrain far better than the invading forces and used this to their advantage, embarrassing the Emperor’s royal forces time and time again. Seldom could Combine infantry units mount even a halfway successful force against the onslaught of Dervish blades and spears. Stories would return to the Combine Empire of the Dervs sheer brutality and savagery which was not entirely unfounded as the Dervish people seldom left survivors. Reports circulated of platoons of soldiers piled 30 feet high, their severed heads buried in the desert sand apart from their bodies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Divided into warring tribes and factions but united in their distaste for the empire, the Dervs continued to resist any attempt made by the Combine Empire to conquer. Many scholars agree that one of the primary reasons the Combine Empire fell was due to its long and drawn-out Dervish campaigns in the treacherous deserts of Ro.  
                    </p>
                    <p>After the collapse of the empire, the Dervs suffered from a long decade of in-fighting in which only the strongest of tribes survived. A long drought left the Lifire river, which had for many long years been the life source of the desert people, dry. It was the charismatic warlord Abudar Bakir who finally ended the hostilities between the tribes. He united many of the Dervish tribes and others he quelled with the might of his superior forces. His only rival was the religious leader Nabil Saleem, a ruthless and powerful Caliph who sequestered himself and his forces within the impenetrable fortress of Maj’Dul, built atop the ruins of an ancient elven city at the mouth of the Lifire River. Abudar Bakir sieged the seaside fortress for several months, starving the citizens within until finally those that were left turned against the Caliph and flayed him within the streets. The next day, Abudar marched into the city with his forces. He was greeted with open arms.
                    </p>
                    <p>In recent years, Abudar Bakir or the “Peacock Sultan” as he is often referred to, has ruled the city and the Dervish Caliphate for over 40 years. Opening the city to trade with neighboring kingdoms has allowed the Caliphate to grow into a powerful mercantile empire. From Maj’Dul the Peacock Sultan controls the spice routes between Freeport and the Hijazrian Empire to the south. His name, the Peacock Sultan, comes from the grand palace he built for himself at the top of the fortress of Maj’Dul. It houses a spectacular, personal garden which features several imported peacocks, their bejeweled feathers sparkling in the ruby red sun of the desert. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As the Peacock Sultan’s health begins to fail him in his old age, rumors surrounding who his successor may be are heard all throughout the Caliphate. His three sons each desire the Sultan’s seat which has engulfed the city of Maj’Dul in a state of uneasy tension. While no violence has erupted in the streets yet, with each passing day the mood grows more fierce.
